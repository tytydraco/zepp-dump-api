# zepp-dump-api
Tools to dump the ZeppOS internal device APIs.

# How
There are two programs here that print out all the internally accessible global methods and fields. The script `dump.sh` starts the simulator and pulls the logs, then parses them. It is a bit finnicky.

# API Dumps
* [API v1.0.1 from Band-7](api-v1.0.1-band7.js)
* [API v1.0.1 backwards-compatible from GTR-4](api-v1.0.1-gtr4.js)
